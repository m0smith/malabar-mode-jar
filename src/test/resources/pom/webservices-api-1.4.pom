    <description>
        Metro is a high-performance, extensible, easy-to-use web service stack.
        It is a one-stop shop for all your web service needs, from the simplest
        hello world web service to reliable, secured, and transacted web service
        that involves .NET services.
        
        This module contains the public APIs. It does not serve any purpose on
        its own and you should instead depend on the parent module
        com.sun.xml.ws.webservices.
